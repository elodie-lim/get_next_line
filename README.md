# Get Next Line

**Get Next Line** is a C function designed to read a line from a file descriptor, developed as part of the 42 curriculum. Its goal is to provide efficient line-by-line reading, whether from a file or standard input.

## Features

- Reads one line at a time from a file or stdin.
- Handles different buffer sizes with `-D BUFFER_SIZE=xx`.
- Returns `NULL` at the end of the file or in case of an error.

## Bonus

- Management of multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
- Use of a single static variable to optimize performance.
